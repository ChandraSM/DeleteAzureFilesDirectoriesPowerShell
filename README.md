Come on guys!! Seriously?

After this successful post of Azure Virtual Machine – Frequently asked questions – not easily answered - https://sanganakauthority.blogspot.com/2019/06/azure-virtual-machine-frequently-asked.html
I got almost 54+ requests/ comments/ emails asking specifically for a blog post on sharing script for “Deleting Azure File Storage Directory using PowerShell”.

Not sure why people felt this is hard to write a PowerShell script. Well, this post is about the same topic and at the end of post you will know how to delete Azure file storage Directory and Files using PowerShell scripting.
You must have read the word in title “Secret sauce of Recursion”; about that later in the post link below.
